Create your first personal wallet for storing SHR tokens on the mainnet! The current version of a website is using the crypto libraries provided by the official [ShareRing](https://sharering.network/en) development team.

### What is a paper wallet?
Crypto wallet is the pair of your **private key** and your **address**. Private key is used to access your funds and send them to other recepients while your address is used to receive the funds. Mnemonic phrase is used to make private key human readable and friendly for memorization. Your mnemonic key can be converted into private key, and private key gives anybody who owns it ultimate control over the funds stored on the address. (Please keep your mnemonic phrase and a private key safe)

### What to do with this wallet?
Generate your wallet and keep it ready for the mainnet release. Imagine, you can be one of the first [ShareRing](https://sharering.network/en) wallet owners in the whole world! Dont lose your mnemonic phrase, it might be probably used to import your wallet into the official [ShareRing](https://sharering.network/en) app when it's released.
